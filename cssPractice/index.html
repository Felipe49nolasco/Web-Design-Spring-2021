        <h1>Description</h1>

        <p>
            During quarantine I play my favorite videogames.<br>
            I also work out using gymanstic rings, a pull up bar, and some dumbells.<br>
            I have been watching way too much YouTube<br>
            What I mostly stick to is doing school work and being in online school.<br>
            Although it is not that great during quarantine, I still enjoy some classes such as Anatomy and math.
